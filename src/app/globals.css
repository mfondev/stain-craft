Edit
⨯ The requested resource isn't a valid image for /images/bgg.webp received text/html; charset=utf-8
[Error: The requested resource isn't a valid image.] { statusCode: 400 }
...usually means that your build process or image optimization tool (like Next.js, Vite, or Astro) is trying to process /images/bgg.webp, but it's either:

Not actually an image, or

The path is incorrect and it's loading an HTML 404 page instead of the image.

Here's how to fix it:
✅ Step 1: Confirm the file path
Check that the file really exists at public/images/bgg.webp. If you’re using:

Next.js: it should be in the public/images/ folder, and you reference it as /images/bgg.webp.

Vite/Astro: you might need to import it if it's inside src/assets/.

✅ Step 2: Open the image directly
Try going to http://localhost:3000/images/bgg.webp in your browser. If you see an error page, then:

The file is not where you think it is, or

The image is corrupt or unreadable.

✅ Step 3: Check for image corruption
Try opening the bgg.webp file in an image viewer or browser. If it doesn’t open, re-export or replace it with a valid .webp image.

✅ Step 4: If you're using an image optimizer
If you're using an image optimizer (like next/image or Astro’s Image component), it might throw this error if the image isn't valid or accessible. As a test, try replacing it with a known good .webp image temporarily.

Would you like to tell me which framework you're using (e.g., Next.js, Vite, Astro) so I can give framework-specific advice?
